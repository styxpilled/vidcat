# vidcat

I often need to rename tons of videos, but I can't rename videos that I have open in VLC. This app allows me to do that + use tons of keyboard shortcuts to rename files faster.

The name is short for Vid(eo) Cat(egoriser).

## keyboard shortcuts

- `space`: play/pause the video 
- `escape`: unfocus the rename field
- `delete`: delete the file
- `r`: focus the rename field
- `arrowup`: select the previous file in the list
- `arrowdown`: select the next file in the list
- `arrowleft`: skip backwards 5 seconds
- `arrowright`: skip forwards 5 seconds

## todo

- [ ] use some sort of OCR with ffmpeg to automatically give files a name
- [ ] use a database with full text search for easier searching
- [ ] flag files that don't include a word using a dictionary
- [ ] file deleting undo
- [ ] image support
